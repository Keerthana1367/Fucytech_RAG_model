Therefore, it’s susceptible for an attacker to gain remote control to the CAN buses of a vulnerable BMW car by utilizing a complex chain of several vulnerabilities existed in different vehicle components.

We show that design choices in the use of power-line communication (PLC) make the system particularly prone to popular electromagnetic side-channel attacks. We implement the first wireless eavesdropping tool for PLC networks and use it to observe the ISO 15118 network implementation underlying CCS, in a measurement campaign of 54 real charging sessions, using modern electric vehicles and state-of-the-art CCS chargers. We find that the unintentional wireless channel is sufficient to recover messages in the vast majority of cases, with traffic intercepted from an adjacent parking bay showing 91.8% of messages validating their CRC32 checksum.</p><p>By examining the recovered traffic, we further find a host of privacy and security issues in existing charging infrastructure including plaintext MAC-layer traffic recovery, widespread absence of TLS in public locations and leakage of private information, including long-term unique identifiers.

However, while previous research has shown that the <em>internal</em> networks within some modern cars are insecure, the associated threat model—requiring <em>prior physical access</em>—has justifiably been viewed as unrealistic. Thus, it remains an open question if automobiles can also be susceptible to <em>remote</em> compromise. Our work seeks to put this question to rest by systematically analyzing the <em>external</em> attack surface of a modern automobile. We discover that remote exploitation is feasible via a broad range of attack vectors (including mechanics tools, CD players, Bluetooth and cellular radio), and further, that wireless communications channels allow long distance vehicle control, location tracking, in-cabin audio exfiltration and theft. Finally, we discuss the structural characteristics of the automotive ecosystem that give rise to such problems and highlight the practical challenges in mitigating them.d arbitrary CAN packets when a particular message arrives over the FM RDS channel.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenix-security-11/comprehensive-experimental-analyses-automotive-attack-surfaces</a></p><p><a href=\"http://\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.usenix.org/events/sec11/tech/full_papers/Checkoway.pdf</a></p>","aliases":["ATM-P0083"],"x_mitre_deprecated":false,"x_mitre_version":"1.0","x_mitre_contributors":{},"type":"campaign","id":"campaign--101fd6f2-2554-53bf-835a-e9af804ff408","created":"2023-12-07T18:41:52.461Z","revoked":false,"x_mitre_attack_spec_version":"1.0","spec_version":"2.1","external_references":[{"source_name":"AutoISAC ATM","url":"https://atm.automotiveisac.com/example/ATM-P0083","external_id":"ATM-P0083"}]},{"type":"relationship","id":"relationship--fdbca5dd-171c-5be3-bf00-15c627e6f0b2","created":"2023-12-07T19:12:46.630Z","revoked":false,"modified":"2025-02-19T21:58:48.245Z","description":"Researchers were able to extract the firmware from several ECUs using voltage fault injection attacks to glitch the read memory UDS service using ChipWhisperer and Inspector FI which can perform fault injection.","relationship_type":"uses","source_ref":"campaign--e40f82de-f22c-5c5c-9e6f-8b03d36e5e8f","target_ref":"attack-pattern--39964dc0-62ce-59ce-8a97-8779ce0ac254","x_mitre_deprecated":false,"x_mitre_version":"1.0","x_mitre_attack_spec_version":"1.0","spec_version":"2.1"},{"type":"relationship","id":"relationship--a6ec7143-01ce-50b1-8d34-a7224b033007","created":"2023-12-07T19:12:46.630Z","revoked":false,"modified":"2025-02-19T21:58:48.245Z","description":"Researchers were able to extract the firmware by performing electromagnetic fault injection to bypass the privilege check for JTAG debug interface.","relationship_type":"uses","source_ref":"campaign--e40f82de-f22c-5c5c-9e6f-8b03d36e5e8f","target_ref":"attack-pattern--ea1db000-ab04-5023-8ae3-7c4ba0a57b63","x_mitre_deprecated":false,"x_mitre_version":"1.0","x_mitre_attack_spec_version":"1.0","spec_version":"2.1"},{"type":"relationship","id":"relationship--41f08233-9379-546a-ab19-988a2c63bfdc","created":"2023-12-07T19:12:46.630Z","revoked":false,"modified":"2025-02-19T21:58:48.245Z","description":"Researchers were able to extract the firmware from several ECUs using voltage fault injection attacks to glitch the read memory UDS service using ChipWhisperer and Inspector FI which can perform fault injection.","relationship_type":"uses","source_ref":"campaign--e40f82de-f22c-5c5c-9e6f-8b03d36e5e8f","target_ref":"attack-pattern--7e7fbedc-4782-5739-bbaa-9108c77889ec","x_mitre_deprecated":false,"x_mitre_version":"1.0","x_mitre_attack_spec_version":"1.0","spec_version":"2.1"},{"type":"relationship","id":"relationship--e5a83059-2f2e-518f-a88d-b523d8d4b202","created":"2023-12-07T19:12:46.630Z","revoked":false,"modified":"2025-02-19T21:58:48.245Z","description":"Researchers were able to extract the firmware from several ECUs using voltage fault injection attacks to glitch the read memory UDS service.\n\nResearchers bypassed the UDS Security Access check by performing a voltage fault injection attack on the UDS ReadMemoryByAddress service.","relationship_type":"uses","source_ref":"campaign--e40f82de-f22c-5c5c-9e6f-8b03d36e5e8f","target_ref":"attack-pattern--1e56f567-a8f9-580d-bb2b-bd91c275d9fe","x_mitre_deprecated":false,"x_mitre_version":"1.0","x_mitre_attack_spec_version":"1.0","spec_version":"2.1"},{"type":"relationship","id":"relationship--ea14e6b2-3246-5e29-945b-3fc5b32c6d0d","created":"2023-12-07T19:12:46.630Z","revoked":false,"modified":"2025-02-19T21:58:48.245Z","description":"Researchers were able to extract the firmware from several ECUs using voltage fault injection attacks to glitch the read memory UDS service using ChipWhisperer and Inspector FI.

These attacks do not rely on an exploitable software vulnerability. Access to the plain-text firmware allows an attacker to understand the ECU’s functionality, extract the ECU’s secrets and identify exploitable software vulnerabilities. We describe multiple techniques in order to analyze binary firmware efficiently. We use an instrument cluster from a modern car to demonstrate the practicality of the described techniques on a real ECU. Finally, we explain the real-world impact of these issues, how they lead to scalable attacks, and what can be done to secure the cars of today and tomorrow.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://raelize.com/upload/research/2018/2018_escareu_There-Will-Be-Glitches-Whitepaper.pdf\" title=\"https://raelize.com/upload/research/2018/2018_escareu_There-Will-Be-Glitches-Whitepaper.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">There Will Be Glitches</a></p>","aliases":["ATM-P0088"],"x_mitre_deprecated":false,"x_mitre_version":"1.0","x_mitre_contributors":{},"type":"campaign","id":"campaign--e40f82de-f22c-5c5c-9e6f-8b03d36e5e8f","created":"2023-12-07T19:12:46.630Z","revoked":false,"x_mitre_attack_spec_version":"1.0","spec_version":"2.1","external_references":[{"source_name":"AutoISAC ATM","url":"https://atm.automotiveisac.com/example/ATM-P0088","external_id":"ATM-P0088"}]},{"modified":"2025-01-30T17:36:03.227Z","name":"IoT backdoors in cars","description":"Researchers were able to read file names, server path, port, version, and other information of unencrypted OTA updates from the GSM Modem by using a logic analyzer, a Python script, and Wireshark.","aliases":["ATM-P0090"],"x_mitre_deprecated":false,"x_mitre_version":"1.0","x_mitre_contributors":{},"type":"campaign","id":"campaign--fec3bbf0-3d38-568f-96f9-407ce1e02c00","created":"2023-12-07T17:46:52.522Z","revoked":false,"x_mitre_attack_spec_version":"1.0","spec_version":"2.1","external_references":[{"source_name":"AutoISAC ATM","url":"https://atm.automotiveisac.com/example/ATM-P0090","external_id":"ATM-P0090"}]},{"modified":"2025-01-30T17:36:03.232Z","name":"IoT backdoors in cars","description":"Researchers were able to spoof GPS coordinates updates by putting a SIM card into a target modem and changing the vehicle’s location through the modem web interface.","aliases":["ATM-P0091"],"x_mitre_deprecated":false,"x_mitre_version":"1.0","x_mitre_contributors":{},"type":"campaign","id":"campaign--1b004a80-1cf5-58e0-b3b9-61ead4cd4dd9","created":"2023-12-07T17:47:29.841Z","revoked":false,"x_mitre_attack_spec_version":"1.0","spec_version":"2.1","external_references":[{"source_name":"AutoISAC ATM","url":"https://atm.automotiveisac.com/example/ATM-P0091","external_id":"ATM-P0091"}]},{"modified":"2025-01-30T17:36:03.263Z","name":"IoT backdoors in cars","description":"Researchers were able to hack nearby dongles of other vehicles by reverse engineering exfiltrated firmware and modifying it to create a custom MITM setup.","aliases":["ATM-P0092"],"x_mitre_deprecated":false,"x_mitre_version":"1.0","x_mitre_contributors":{},"type":"campaign","id":"campaign--d5c1c8b8-428f-5fd9-964f-4e160ca916da","created":"2023-12-07T17:48:50.339Z","revoked":false,"x_mitre_attack_spec_version":"1.0","spec_version":"2.1","external_references":[{"source_name":"AutoISAC ATM","url":"https://atm.automotiveisac.com/example/ATM-P0092","external_id":"ATM-P0092"}]},{"modified":"2025-01-30T17:36:03.268Z","name":"Remote Exploitation of an Unaltered Passenger Vehicle","description":"Researchers were able to track a Jeep Cherokee's location by querying the GPS coordinates of the vehicle.

Recent recommendations can be found in Recommendation for Key Management: Part 1 - General, Cryptographic Mechanisms: Recommendations and Key Lengths, Version 2024-01.</p><p>The implementation of cryptographic primitives is flawed. Recommendation: use carefully selected providers of cryptographic code. Examples of such flaws include: o Information leakage through timing (CWE - CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy (4.16), Challenge 17 Set 3 - The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges). An example of this has been observed in a fielded automotive product. o Parameters which are insufficiently “strong” in all possible use-cases.  e=3 in RSA encryption of small messages  e=3 in RSA signature validation with incorrect padding validation. This has been observed in a fielded automotive product. o Summary of RSA flaws: Twenty years of attacks on the RSA Cryptosystem.</p><p>The cryptographic primitive does not provide the property the use-case requires. Recommendation: carefully review all uses of cryptography to ensure the correct properties are defended. o For example, “encryption” does not provide “integrity” or “authenticity”. Challenge 16 Set 2 - The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges.</p><p>The structure/protocol has vulnerabilities (despite using a good cryptographic primitive).

It gives us two distinct capabilities: First, it enables the first unpatchable AMD-based \"Tesla Jailbreak\", allowing us to run arbitrary software on the infotainment. Second, it will enable us to extract an otherwise vehicle-unique hardware-bound RSA key used to authenticate and authorize a car in Tesla's internal service network.<br><br>For this, we are using a known voltage fault injection attack against the AMD Secure Processor (ASP), serving as the root of trust for the system. First, we present how we used low-cost, off-the-self hardware to mount the glitching attack to subvert the ASP's early boot code. We then show how we reverse-engineered the boot flow to gain a root shell on their recovery and production Linux distribution.<br><br>Our gained root permissions enable arbitrary changes to Linux that survive reboots and updates. They allow an attacker to decrypt the encrypted NVMe storage and access private user data such as the phonebook, calendar entries, etc. On the other hand, it can also benefit car usage in unsupported regions. Furthermore, the ASP attack opens up the possibility of extracting a TPM-protected attestation key Tesla uses to authenticate the car. This enables migrating a car's identity to another car computer without Tesla's help whatsoever, easing certain repairing efforts.</p><p></p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tLNRk7mZXo\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tLNRk7mZXo\" target=\"_blank\">Presentation video</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/index.html#jailbreaking-an-electric-vehicle-in--or-what-it-means-to-hotwire-teslas-x-based-seat-heater-33049\" title=\"https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/index.html#jailbreaking-an-electric-vehicle-in--or-what-it-means-to-hotwire-teslas-x-based-seat-heater-33049\" target=\"_blank\">Presentation site with links to slides and tools</a></p><p><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32156\" title=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32156\" target=\"_blank\">Exploited CVE</a></p><p></p><p></p>","aliases":["ATM-P0198"],"x_mitre_deprecated":false,"x_mitre_version":"1.0","x_mitre_contributors":{},"type":"campaign","id":"campaign--716897bc-0588-5a0c-bfef-1d32d67a0a8d","created":"2025-05-01T19:35:24.115Z","revoked":false,"x_mitre_attack_spec_version":"1.0","spec_version":"2.1","external_references":[{"source_name":"AutoISAC ATM","url":"https://atm.automotiveisac.com/example/ATM-P0198","external_id":"ATM-P0198"}]}]}
